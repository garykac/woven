Woven playtest
2 Dec 2022 - PAX Unplugged

JoeyS, SameerN

# Setup

6 hex tile arranged around a center hex tile.

Capture the Frog.

Each player starts game with 2 spells in hand + draw up to 5

Capture the Frog:
The toad can only be moved using Eyes, and they move at 1/2 speed (round down) when moving the toad.
You cannot move your own toad. It can only be moved toward the tower.

Move to center tower to draw 3, choose 2 spells to keep.

# Rules being tested

Players each have a conveyor belt of spells.
Recover a Thread from their Tapestry when they discard the right-most (oldest) spell from
the conveyor.

# Notes

10:25 - 11:45 - teach + gameplay + discussion

Arrange tapestry cards - how long does this take?

Swap order of cast/recover actions.

When forced to remove cards from the conveyor, do you still recover a thread?

When a new Tapestry card is added, it must be melded before the start of the next turn.

Expand spell may be too powerful.

When are Anchors removed?

* when the spell retires
* whenever the mage wants

Anchors cannot be turn back into Eyes.

Cannot pull Anchors, Threads or Charges back at will. Only Eyes.

Swap pattern for Duplicate and Expand

Wants to be able to pick up toad mid-turn

Terminology: Attack, Creature - be explicit

# Comments

S:

Likes the capture the flag game - doesn't see that a lot.
Places to defend + places to attack.

Likes setting up Tapestry

J:

Actions gated by:

* If eyes were in a separate turn - cycle the mage/player
* wanted to move & eye - mundane move + attack

Maybe 4 player with 2 specialized spells per player

S:

Being able to place an Anchor over the Toad - too powerful

J: Broken? weak if you have to be on the spot. Adjacent might be better.
