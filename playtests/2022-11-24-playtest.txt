# Setup

3-player arena with hex tiles arranged in Y configuration

Capture the Frog.

Each player has 8 starter spells + 2 random

The toad can only be moved using Eyes, and they move at 1/2 speed (round down) when moving the toad.
You cannot move your own toad. It can only be moved toward the tower.

If you move to the center tower, you can get new spells. Draw 2 choose 1.

# Rules being tested

Setup:
    Shuffle initial deck
    Draw 5 cards into hand

PlayGame:
    Repeat until goal achieved:
        PlayerTurn
        NextPlayerClockwise

PlayerTurn:
    TakeAction
    Optionally, Reset
    ! If you have 0 cards in hand, you must Reset

TakeAction:
    Play a card:
        * Add it to the Available area to prepare to cast
        * Discard it to gain its alternate Effect (at bottom of card)
    Optionally, add mana to Tapestry to cast one or more Available spells and trigger their effects

Reset:
    Discard all spells from the Available area (unless they have mana charges on them)
    Optionally, choose card(s) from hand to Forget (remove from game)
    Discard some or all of your Hand
    Draw Hand up to 5 cards 

# Notes

Looking at spell cards before creating Tapestry.
	Too much info all at once trying to match all spells.
	Take a long time to arrange Tapestry at start

Players wanted to Reset each turn to draw new cards
	Maybe should only save 1 card when resetting?

The Bridge across the river is closer to one side so player felt it was easier to move
toward their location.

Spread spell moves each Eye 3 spaces

Air Walk - don't need to move entire distance. "up to" n spaces

Do you have to move the toad when you move your Eye away from that spot?
	eg: 2 eyes on same spot with toad. want to move one away
	not required.

Need to mark 1 side of each mana to identify when it's being used as a anchor

Can players create an Anchor by the tower to block toads from arriving?

Duplicate. Anchors are no longer Eyes and cannot be duplicated.

The Draw Tapestry ability on the Shield card. If you have a Shield in force, then you
have a reduced ability to do the Draw Tapestry action.

Not much incentive to move.
Consider forcing players to move to center tower before they can move toads.

# Comments

C:

Shield feels weak

In this game, it's better to move the toad

Move feels slow. the char is not really vulnerable.

Air Walk would be a good basic spell. Or another movement spell. Needs more mage movement.

Liked spell casting. Tricky to learn, but good when figured out.

The Tapestry felt a bit like scrabble.
	Set up words on board with high-value spaces, making combos

Shield (starter) vs Reflect (extra spell)
	Reflect is strictly better than Shield.
	Shield mostly useful for it's mundane abilities

Fire & Water better than Air & Earth

Fun to set up spells. to plan for certain spells

Strategies for which mana to take off the tapestry

A:

Had cards that couldn't be played. Sorted cards into 2 categories: can use vs need to discard
Could only use certain spells because of how the Tapestry was built

Would you do better next game? Hard to master

C:

Reset to get cards / get mana

S:

Reset a lot to try to get the same card again

Set up Tapestry so that only 1 mana was needed to cast 2 different spells when needed

Liked moving Eyes. Liked duplicate

A:

Time seemed to flow differently for different parts of game.  Eyes move.

Felt like he had to keep resetting.

C:

Perhaps 2 copies of each spell.

Actions depend on lot on timing (when you get cards), so multiple copies might help.

Favorite part

* S: duplicate, spread, guard
* C: exciting dramatic moments during play - avoiding attack, big moves
* A: move around map, duplicate eye, push an eye around

C:

Notes on teaching:

Anchors - be careful with terminology. Anchors are separate from Eyes. Not "anchored eye"

Difference between discarding and playing a card and immediately discarding.
