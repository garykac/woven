22 Sep 2020

## Setup

* Is center area too crowded?

Start with 4 mana (+7 more in reserve)

Start along edge at low elevation

## Co-op

You can add an Eye on the map in other player's locations

To cast charged spell for other player:

* You cast spell as normal
* Charge placed on spell must come from other player

## Your Turn

Take 1 action

Free actions you may take at any time during your turn:

* Recover an Eye back into your Mana pool
* Recover a Charge back into your Mana pool

At end of your turmn, if you are in the same location as a Ruin:

* Draw an artifact
* Place it at bottom of discard pile

### Recover Action

#### Acquisition

For each wellspring where you have an Eye:

* You may spend 1 for an extra Mana
* Any remaining may be used to acquire spells:
    * Draw N cards (where N equals remaining wellsprings) ???: Max N?
    * Choose 1
    * Optionally: Choose a spell from your hand to add to your Treasure
    * Return remaining spells to bottom of spell deck (for TTS add to deck and re-shuffle)
* If you did not acquire a spell, then Trash to top spell card

#### Reset Active Spells

* Move any non-Charged active spells to your discard

#### Draw Hand

* Draw hand back up to 4 cards

Note that you do not discard any remaining cards in your hand

## Citadel Defense

### Watchers

Watchers alway take the shortest path to their Target.
If multiple same-length paths to a Target, then they take the path that takes them furthest away from the Citadel.

Watchers detect if you move (on your turn) into a space within 3.
They will immediately change their target to you and the target will follow you until:

* You are more than 5 spaces away from one of the normal targets
* You enter a Ruin

Watchers are also sensitive to magic and will detect you if you have an Eye in their location.
You will be targeted if you are within 5 spaces of a Watcher Target.

#### Attacking a Watcher

When attacking a Watcher, first calculate how much damage you're inflicting.
Then reveal the next Watcher card to determine its strength.

If you defeat a Watcher, it will crash to the ground in that location.
The Mage who defeated the Watcher takes the Watcher card and 1 Treasure cards and adds them to their Treasure pile.
The Watcher token stays on the map until its remains can be ransacked.
The player to ransacks the Watcher remains gains 2 Treasure.

### Sentries

Sentries detect if you move into adjacent space

When defeated, they player takes 1 Treasure card.

When do they re-spawn? Draw cards? Do we need markers on board as a reminder?


## Scoring

Calculate Artifact bonus for each player

Merge the following cards together:

* Treasure piles and player decks for all players
* Any spells remaining in the spell deck

Add all the stars on the cards

Score = Stars + Artifact bonus

Bonus?

* For destroying the citadel? For everyone surviving?

* Need Sentry cards: re-spawn, treasure/hp, detect, attack
* Need target markers for Watchers
