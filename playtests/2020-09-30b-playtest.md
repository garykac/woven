Start game on half tile

can cast same spell multiple times

draw 1 treasure cards when explore. 2 is too many?

balance

use mage for wellspring
can look at card but can't pay

early game
too many costs for Eyes
    to acquire more Mana and acquire spells

casting spell with multiple squares
not either/or

Make cliff borders easier to see



Jay
What player experience?
A: casting magic

solitaire
running the map

get to tower, get a prize
if fun is mana, and casting spells
    depending on length
is there a reason to not speed it up

cost of having guys out on map
having to pay for cards
i don't think it's bad to pay for it

mana is probably in check already


Towers:
expectred a defender or something more difficult
a obstacle, not just a gimme

would be nice if there was a sacrifice needed

Make towers not be a wellspring afterwards

what is the viable stragety to not use towers

Jay
is there always a single best starting spot along edge of map

Artifacts one-time use

Wellsprings for meditating, spells
Towers for Artifact, treasure

What about depletion markers on wellsprings?
Likes it the way it is.

Player wants to protect an area.

Put tokens on each wellspring.
random dist. maybe 0, maybe 2

What if you 

if wellspring run dry

Towers to teleport to other tower instead of exploring

Tripped up by pattern
Other fighting games with patterns
Like Tash-Khalar - show options, not requirements


Jay:

Tapestry
Thought it was really cool
Reminded me of FFX
    huge grid of abilities in a tech tree
likes being able to choose what kind of mage

Other ways to use these without adding components
start out with the Towers
    when Towers are removed, something triggers on the map
escalating the destruction of the world

spell power related to # of Towers on map

Threads
be able to place on elements - get special ability

Early game, you want Air
because of Haste

would be cool if you fill up 2 spots on Tapestry, then you get mana
or cover Fire to get something
something different if you cover up Air
this can be used to temper how strong Air is at the beginning.

Place Thread on top of another thread

Cool is spell that needed 5 or 6 and gave a lot of VP
maybe does something like require multiple element

Would like Create Eye to be Free

Mundane Action to change -> if on Wellspring you can get new mana

Need to have win condition for people hwo want to chase the most mana

Mundane
Move
Meditate
Focus
Gain Mana
