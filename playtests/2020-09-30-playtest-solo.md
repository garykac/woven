In Solo

There is nothng that attacks your eyes, so there is no reason to have
spells that defend against that.

Concealment is not useful if no monsters.



Not necessary to move Watchers at beginning.
Something should trigger their activation. First Artifact? or entering Citadel tile?


When gaining new spells, why not just draw into hand and then discard?
Get spell immediately.

Not charging Mana for spells means that you just accumulate Eyes on the board
and don't move them around.
Gaining spells should cost 1 Mana
Or choose not to take one and 1 is discarded


Artifacts allow you to draw extra card into hand.
Otherwise giving 2 actions if you have 2 Artifacts in hand.
Or Artifact should have Draw card + take 2 actions on bottom.
Or Artifact should have Action + take another action.

Need to spend 2 Treasure cards to attack the Citadel.
If no more Towers remain, then you may attack Citadel without cost.

TODO:

Make Citadel card
Tweak artifact abilities and bonuses
Change cost and VP for spells
