Acquire 3rd token


Status at end
9 turns
11 spellsets to capture 3 tokens
Players cast avg ~3 spells/turn
Blue:
	7 mana (5 in tapestry)
	3 shields
	0 potions + 2 in tapestry
Red:
	7 mana (5 in tapestry)
	2 shields
	1 potion + 1 in tapestry

Recover covered mana + 1 felt good -- better tapestry shapes
	More likely to choose to cover only 1 to build better tapestry shape because of bonus mana
	Less desperate, more planning
Single bonus move was fine as well
	Not a big impact when Haste is available, however
Goal of 3 crystals felt better than arbitrary # of spellsets
	Kept focus on the map
Bonuses associated with completing spellsets was good
	Esp eliminate/replace monster, which could be used strategically
A bit too easy to achieve goal:
	10 rooms is probably too big for 2 players. go back to 8.

Notes:
Monsters always attack closest target - you choose only if multiple in same room
Monster shields reset at the start of each turn
	No need to track monster damage across turns
Is Faux Mana too good? How hard is it to pass without that spell available?
Movement doesn't need to be spent immediately
	But is lost if not spent at end of turn
	May need a way to track available movement points
Better to remove all non-present monsters from deck at start of game
