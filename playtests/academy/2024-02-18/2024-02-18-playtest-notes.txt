Summary:
	17 cards in each tapestry. 34 Tapestry cards used.
	Churned through 6 monsters at the start. Made monsters static after turn 5
		The churn at the start felt too fast
		The monsters at the end felt too static
	4 of each monster on board when game ended.


Comments:
? Too much monster churn at start (since they respawn if all are defeated and when there's only 1...)
	Is it worthwhile to respawn when monster is defeated?
		Add special event as players complete spellsets
	But it is nice to have the monsters rotate out periodically
? Is ramp up too slow at higher player counts
	Maybe start with monsters = # of players
Would like a second attack spell - perhaps transform into animal that can choose move or attack
	Only 1 attack spell limits how to fend off the monsters
Since the only way to recover mana is to cover tapestry cards, it encourages placing Tapesty cards on top of existing rather than expanding.
	Which is not necessarily a problem, but I think a bit more expansion would be nice
	? Start with more mana
	? Recover 1 mana per turn - interesting decision with placing Tapestry card
Note: When attacked, mana can be removed from Tapestry before available pool
	It doesn't have to come from available - that would feel harsh
Once you have 1 mana left, you can't do anything. but at least everyone gets another turn to cast.
	I don't think this is a problem
Some monsters need to be amped up

Game went longer than it should have, because:
	Some monsters were too easy to avoid
		Moved slowly, so easy to "hide" in room on other side
		Monster attack range is small
	Monsters ramped up slowly at the beginning
	Many monsters didn't have a home base on the map, so they shared the default starting location
		2 player = 7 rooms (out of 13) + neutral start
		Start with more rooms to reduce this?

For next test:
	Start with more monsters on board (= player count, or always 4?)
	Review monsters and increase: range, movement
	More rooms
	Add events when spellsets are complete
	
Possible Spellset events
* Everyone recover 1 mana
* Replace 1 monster with a new draw
* Potions
* New spell added to set. Or swap out?
