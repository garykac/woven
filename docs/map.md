# Map

## Size

Mulitple maps:

* Geomorphic - the edges match so they can be combined to form a larger map.
* Voronoi tesselation - irregular division of map into organic "hex-ish" locations
* 5 special locations marked on each map

## Terrain Types

* Field (cost = 1 MP)
* Forest (cost = 2 MP)
* Mountain (cost = 3 MP)
* River (between locations) (cost = 2MP + cost of terrain on other side)
* Water/Swamp cannot be entered without a special ability

### Rivers

The location on either side of a river is adjacent to water.

## Special locations

### Field

* Pit

### Forest

* Quicksand

### Mountain

* Volcano
* Cave

## Options for Expansion

Need to determine how spell effects would work with the new terrain type.

Temp variation?  Hot / Temperate / Cold

Water variation? Dry / Normal / Wet

Possible other terrain types?

* Marsh/Bog/Swamp (temperate/cold wet Plain)
* Jungle/Rainforest (hot wet forest)
* Hills
* Tundra (cold dry Plain)
* Desert, Steppe (hot dry Plain)
* Water/Ocean/Sea/Lake Shallow/Deep
