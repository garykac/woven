# Background

You are a mage.

It took you many long years of study to get here - years that stretched your spirit and separated you in multiple ways from your original form - but you survived and here you are, more or less.

Your current body has a vague resemblence to what it looked like before you began your studies; at least it does as much as you can remember back to that time. The details don't matter as long as you get the general form correct.

Was your physical body (well, "bodies" now, I suppose) always this weak and fragile? No matter, your strength lies elsewhere and these bodies are temporary. And what does it matter to you if one of them dies at this point. Death for you is a temporary inconvenience. A brief glitch.

Your preparations at the Academy taught you more than just how to manipulate the elements and form them to your will. It also taught you how to bind portions of your spirit to the planes so that Death can't get a firm grip. And the portion of spirit that you bound to Earth allows you to return when your current body is torn from you (a curiously frequent event). Your old body is long gone, but these new one work well enough.

Besides, as long as your spirit continues, you can construct a new form. As long as your spirit continues, you can still... exist.
