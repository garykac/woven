# Obsolete Spells

Spells that have been removed from the game along with a rational.

## Targeting

* Long distance target
	* Why: no longer have parameters for distance
* Obscure target and neighboring hexes (existing targets stay, but new ones cannot be made)
	* Why: This requires some marker for the obscured location

## Astral Movement

* Teleport to terrain type
	* Why: Set tendril to terrain instead

## Attack

* Affect target creature's Dice or Matrix cards
* Disrupt - player with most of matching Element loses dice or matrix cards
* Take dice from target and add to your pool
* More variety of attacks - target only shields / dodge defenses

## Protection

* Boost Defense Power of chained spells by 1
* More powerful defense
* More variety of shields (stronger/weaker against certain elements, reflect attack back at attacker)

## Summoning

* Summon Minion that you can control
* Summon creature of a particular type
* Summon creature (type determined by terrain)
	* Enchant forest to raise Ents
	* Enchant Pit to raise undead army
* Summon Elemental that you can't control

## Spell Deck Manipulation

* Search top N cards of a spell deck for spell that matches Element
	* Why: no longer have decks of spells; also tends to be tedious

## Map

* Destroy bridges (and other objects on map)
	* Why: want to avoid special tokens for marking updated terrain
* Terraform - change terrain of target location
	* Why: don't want special tokens for marking new terrain

## Misc

* Clone spell from another player
* Duplicate spell just cast
	* Why: can be achieved more generally by allowing a thread to be removed
* Spells that work with any element
* Dispel
	* Why: Use more specific cancel spells.

* Gain extra mana permanently - this spell can only be cast once
* Lose cubes - must be recovered as if from Matrix
* Place cube ignoring contraints
	* Why: No longer have constraints
