Adam suggested yesterday that allowing players to attack each other could be removed (in the context of the starter game: Capture the Frog).

My initial thought is that the ability to attack is needed because that's the primary motivation for players to create/move eyes (attack/defense spells).

But I don't want attack spells to be the primary way that players solve the task. Which is the dilemma that prompted Adam to ask why they are allowed at all.

So, further thoughts on this...

Core game components/mechanisms

Tapestry
	Threads
	Make patterns from spells
Map
	Terrain
	Eyes
	Mage
Spells
	Connects tapestry to map effects
	Patterns for tapestry
	Effects on map



First Game Requirements/Goals:

Introduce all the core mechanics

Spells that:
	Move the Mage
	Are affected by terrain (otherwise play on generic grid)
	Create/Move Eyes

A reason for the player to:
	Want to move the Mage (a goal)
	Want to cast spells (vs. non-spell ways of doing the same thing)
	Want to create/move Eyes


Why do players want to create/move eyes?

Spell effects that depend on Eyes:
	A few movement/terrain spells
	Attack spells (attack mage)
	Defense (anchor, attack eye)
Note: Almost all are (currently) related to attack/defense

Capture The Frog added an extra use for Eyes:
	Moving the Toad

How to increase usefulness of Eyes
	Generalize and extend using Eyes to move objects
	Add more movement spells that depend on Eyes
	Other spells?
	
tl;dr
The game needs spells that motivate player to create/move Eyes
Attack spells are (currently) the easiest spells to depend on Eyes
The Capture The Frog scenario added an alternate use for Eyes
Need to make more non-attack spells that depend on eyes
Then we can introduce attack/defense in a later scenario (after all, it is a school)
