Clone - when another mage casts an AIR spell, sacrifice a charge to duplicate the effect. Your effect takes place after the original spell is complete.

Clone - Place a charge on any currently charged spell (of any mage). Gain benefits as if you had cast the original spell.

Copy - As long as you have most AIR symbols in your tapestry, you may immediately copy any AIR spells that are cast by other mages

Devotion - As long as you cast only AIR spells, each spell you cast acts as if you had cast it twice. Once you cast a non-AIR spell, you may not cast AIR spells for 2 turns.

Attack - place a mana onto another mage's tapestry, covering an element.

Attack - affects all mages with less AIR in tapestry than you have
