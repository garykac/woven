# Tapestry Card Placement

Each player has a Tapestry of cards in front of them
that allow them to cast spells. After the first
Tapestry card (which is simply placed in front of the
player), when Tapestry cards are placed they must overlap
part of a previously placed card in the Tapestry.

For example:

![Card overlap](../img/placement1a.png)

or rotated

![Card overlap](../img/placement1b.png)

Cards can overlap multiple spaces when placed:

![Card overlap](../img/placement4.png)

Or they can even cover an entire card:

![Card overlap](../img/placement6.png)

## Invalid Placement

The following placement is invalid because the placed
card does not overlap with a previously placed card.

![Invalid - Cards must overlap](../img/placement0.png)

Cards may not be tucked under previously placed cards.
