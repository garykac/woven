There are 3 levels of magic actions:


Core Actions:
These are low-level requirements for casting or for the game mechanics to work.
These actions are available on the bottom of the spell cards, so they are easily available as an alternate to casting the spell.

* Place Eye on Map (from Mana pool)
* Recover Thread from Tapestry (to Mana pool)
* Add card to Tapestry
* Move mage a single space
* Take an additional action
* Move a thread to a new location on the Tapestry (without casting)

Maybe:
* Draw additional spell cards into hand

Basic Spells:
The spells perform basic actions or allow the mage to set up preconditions for more advanced spells.
These should also demonstrate all the basic mechanics of the game (all transitions in the mana lifecycle).
Also includes some spells that might be too powerful for a single player to have exclusively.

* Move mage magically (more quickly than normal)
* Move Eyes on the map
* Trigger effect at one or your Eyes
* Anchor Eye
* Dispel Eye
* Attack mage
* Defend mage
* Split Eyes on map


Other Spells:
These are spells that you (might) gain during the course of the game.
Mostly specialized variants or combinations of the above that are either more powerful or easier to cast.



Handling Damage:
There are 4 parts of the game that could be used to encode damage:
* Mage - physical damage: mage has a single HP so it doesn't need to be tracked
* Tapestry - severe mental damage or psychic attacks: block spaces or cover elements
* Spells - light mental damage: add "confusion" cards to the your spell deck
* Mana - mental exhaustion: having fewer available

More details:

Mage damage:
Simple insta-death since mages are weak. Some variants may have re-spawn points.

Tapestry:
This is a safe area for the base game, but expansions could:
Fill spots with dark mana that cannot be removed
Cover element symbols so they can no longer be used to cast spells
Once Dark mana has taken root, it can expand, so you need to fight it off

Spells:
Draw a random Confusion card after a mental attack.
Each Confusion card has a Mana cost (from 2-4).
To Trash a Confusion card (when you reset), you need to pay the mana cost into your Tapestry (anywhere, but it doesn't cast a spell)
Temporarily forget a spell:
	Select one at random
	Place facedown in front of you
	Continue playing
	How do you get this spell back?
	At end of each turn, you may place a mana on the spell. When you place the 4th, you may add it to your discard.

Mana:
Respawn after physical death with 1 fewer Mana token.
